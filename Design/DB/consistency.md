# The word consistency is terribly overloaded:

• Replica consistency and the issue of eventual consistency that arises in asynchronously replicated systems (“Problems with Replication Lag”).
• Consistent hashing is an approach to partitioning that some systems use for rebalancing
• In the CAP theorem (see Chapter 9), the word consistency is used to mean linearizability. Illusion that there is only one replica.
• In the context of ACID, consistency refers to an application-specific notion of the
database being in a “good state.”
