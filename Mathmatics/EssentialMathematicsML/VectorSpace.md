# Vector Space
Vector Space v(R) over a field R is a set on which two operation - vector addition and scaler multiplication are defined such that 
    Property 1 (M1) - (V, +) forms an abelian group.
    M2 - operation scalar multiplication is defined between scalars and vectors such that 
        ∀ a ∈ R and v ∈ V => a*v ∈ V
    M3 - ∀ a ∈ R and v, w ∈ V => a * (v + w) = a * v + a * w
    M4 -  ∀ a, b ∈ R and v ∈ V => (a + b) * v = a * v + b * v
    M5 -  ∀ a, b ∈ R and v ∈ V => (ab)*v = a (b*v)
    M6 - Unitary Law
        ∃ 1 ∈ R such that 1 * v = v ∀ v ∈ V
