# Gen AI - Introduction
Generative AI = Generative + AI
    Using AI to generate something.
    Older AI are conventional AI system - Prediction; Analyzing.
    Gen AI goes one step ahead and give generative capabilities.

ChatGPT - Generate Text
Dall-E - Generate Image
GitHub CoPilot - Generate Code
    Generating new content. It is not coming from somewhere.

Generative AI is a type of AI that can create new content, such as audio, image, text, code, video etc.

# AI, ML and Deep Learning
# AI - Artificial Intelligence
Human is most intelligent species on earth.
Human = Intelligence

AI - Making machine intelligent like Human.

AI is a broad field of computer science that focus on creating intelligent system capable of performing tasks that typically requires human intelligence.

# ML - Machine Learning
ML is subset of AI that focus on the development of algorithms and models that enable computer to learn and make prediction or decisions without explicit programming.

How Human learn that it is apple? Memorize some unique properties of apple so he tell apple from fruits.

Similarly, we show several images of apple and other fruit to machine.
    Lots of training data
    Computational Power
    Algorithms

# Deep Learning
Variation of ML.
It is based on concept Neuron. 
Neuron - Our mind have network of neurons. Processing data, transmission of information to other part.

Replicate this - Neural Network

Input Layer > Hidden Layers > Output Layer


DL perform much better than ML.

DL is a subset of ML that focus on teaching computers to learn and make decision by processing data through NN inspired by Human Brain. 

# Gen AI - Recap
Gen AI is subset of Deep Learning.

Convetional AI System -
    Input Data > AI > Prediction; Classification; Clustering; NLP; Computer Vision.

Generative AI System -
    Input Data > AI > Generate - Text; Image; Audio; Video; Source Code

Takeaway
    Large volume "Good Quality" data
    Shift to conversational, contextual understanding.

# Explore ChatGPT: Features and Capabilities
It is a language model developed by OpenAI. It is designed for Natural Language Understanding and Generation, specifically in conversational context.

LLM - AI that are good in human language.

    How many airport in New York? 
    Answer in simple text.
    Which one is near to New Jersy? // So, it refer context.

    Note - Data that feed is 2021.. So, its output will not be latest one.
        It is not stateless.
